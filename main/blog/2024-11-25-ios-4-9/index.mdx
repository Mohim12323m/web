## New Compass Behavior

The compass button has been updated to provide more intuitive and user-friendly functionality. These improvements make the compass easier to use, help you navigate better, and optimize map orientation control during navigation.

Map rotation North fixed for  **North is up** compass position.

[Compass button](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map/#map-orientation-and-compass): 

- **Single tap**. Reorients the map *to the North* in all map orientation modes. If the map is in the *Compass direction* mode, it rotates for one moment and then returns to the dynamic orientation of this mode.
- **Double tap**. Switch between map orientation modes, such as following the GPS direction or rotating with the device. *Until this update, you could switch modes using Single tap*.
- **Long tap**. Opens a handy list with the names of all map orientation modes, allowing you to select the one you prefer.


## Search by Brand Names

We are pleased to introduce a new [brand search](https://osmand.net/docs/user/search/search-poi#how-to-use) feature in OsmAnd that will allow you to find your favorite places faster. You can now filter POIs by specific brands, making it faster to find what you are looking for.  

Whether you are interested to find your favorite coffee shop, hotel, or reliable supermarket, this update makes discovering nearby locations from your favorite brands easier. Enjoy a personalized and efficient search and optimize your travels with OsmAnd.

## Widget Context menu

The [Widget Context](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen/#panel-widgets-settings) menu allows you to manage and configure widgets directly from the map screen, providing a quick way to organize panels. You can access this menu by **_long tapping_** on any widget to customize the layout of widgets without leaving the map.

## Redesign Graphs

Elevation graphs have been redesigned:  Y-axis labels no longer overlap with the graph.

## Grouped Tags

Grouped all POI tags with translations into a single item on the [Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#details) for: `name`, `alt name`, `old name`. 

## Nearby Areas

These updates enhance **Polygon Information** by making data about surrounding areas accessible from the [Map Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu/#details) in OsmAnd.

Now, after _a long tap_ on the map or _a single tap_ a POI, you can view detailed information on nearby polygons, including type and name, sorted by size from smallest to largest. This feature is helpful for quickly identifying geographic or administrative areas within your location.
