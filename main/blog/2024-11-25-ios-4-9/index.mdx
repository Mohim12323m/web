## New Compass Behavior

The compass button has been updated to provide more intuitive and user-friendly functionality. These improvements make the compass easier to use, help you navigate better, and optimize map orientation control during navigation.

[Compass button](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/interact-with-map/#map-orientation-and-compass): 

- **Single tap**. Reorients the map *to the North* in all map orientation modes. If the map is in the *Compass direction* mode, it rotates for one moment and then returns to the dynamic orientation of this mode.
- **Double tap**. Switch between map orientation modes, such as following the GPS direction or rotating with the device. *Until this update, you could switch modes using Single tap*.
- **Long tap**. Opens a handy list with the names of all map orientation modes, allowing you to select the one you prefer.

### Locked Map Rotation

We had an [extensive discussion](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/issues/17561#issuecomment-1623105410) with our users regarding fixing the map's rotation to always point North when using the compass.

As a result, map rotation is now fixed with North at the top when the compass button is set to the [**North is up**](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/map-buttons#map-orientation-modes) position. In this mode, users can zoom in and out on the map, but rotation is disabled.

## Search by Brand Names

We're excited to introduce a new [brand search](https://osmand.net/docs/user/search/search-poi#how-to-use) feature in OsmAnd, designed to help you find your favorite places more quickly. With this update, you can filter POIs by specific brands, streamlining your search experience.

Whether you're looking for a favorite coffee shop, hotel, or a trusted supermarket, this feature makes discovering nearby locations from your preferred brands effortless. Enjoy a more personalized and efficient search experience to optimize your travels with OsmAnd.

## Widget Context menu

The [Widget Context](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/configure-screen/#panel-widgets-settings) menu enables you to manage and configure widgets directly from the map screen, offering a quick and convenient way to organize panels. Simply **_long-press_** any widget to access this menu and customize your widget layout without leaving the map view.

## Redesign Graphs

Elevation graphs have been redesigned to improve readability: Y-axis labels are now positioned to prevent overlapping with the graph.

## Track Menu Updates

### Total Tracks Statistics

The [overall tracks statistics](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/manage-tracks#folder-statistics) are now conveniently displayed in the folder footer. These include: `Tracks â€“ 4, distance â€“ 246.6 km, uphill â€“ 325 m, downhill â€“ 456 m, duration â€“ 08:50:35, Total size â€“ 14 MB.`

### Tracks Filters for Search

Added [the filtering in the Tracks tab](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/tracks/smart-folder/#search-filter), which is done by searching by several criteria, such as duration, length. 

![Track filters iOS](./img/track_filters.png)

## Updates for Map Mode Menu

Introduced a new [Map mode](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/vector-maps#map-mode), allowing the map to automatically switch between light and dark themes based on the selected mode from the available options.

![Map mode iOS](https://osmand.net/assets/images/map_mode_4-9_ios-ca48bf82a5918214a8819924e38cdb72.png)

## Grouped Tags

Consolidated all POI tags with translations into a single item in the [Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu#details) including  `name`, `alt name`, `old name`. 

## Nearby Areas

These updates enhance **Polygon Information**, making data about surrounding areas easily accessible from the [Map Context menu](https://osmand.net/docs/user/map/map-context-menu/#details) in OsmAnd.

With a _long tap_ on the map or a _single tap_ on a POI, you can now view detailed information about nearby polygons, including their type and name, sorted by size from smallest to largest. This feature is particularly useful for quickly identifying geographic or administrative areas near your location.

## Profile Appearance Redesign

The [appearance of profiles](https://osmand.net/docs/user/personal/profiles/#my-location-appearance) has been improved to make them more interesting, recognizable, and usable. 

The update includes:
- New icon and color selection components.
- Redesign of the location icon selection map.
- Default 3D icons,
- Added visual elements for the Resting and Navigation positions below the my location icon:
  - **View angle**. Displays a cone-shaped area that shows the direction you are currently facing.  
  Status: *Off*, &nbsp;*Resting position*, &nbsp;*Navigation position*, &nbsp;*Rest & navigation position*.  
  - **Location radius**. Shows a circular area around your icon, representing the accuracy of your current location.  
  Status: *Off*, &nbsp;*Resting position*, &nbsp;*Navigation position*, &nbsp;*Rest & navigation position*.  


##  Quick Action Updates

### Location position screen


Added the option to create a Quick Action button for changing the [Location position on screen](https://osmand.net/docs/user/widgets/quick-action#settings). This setting lets you enable or disable the display of the previously selected My Location cursor position on the map.
